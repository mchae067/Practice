# Your character can make small jumps and big jumps.
# Small jumps are equal to 1 unit while big jumps are equal to 7.
# Write a program to calculate the number of small and big jumps needed
# to scale a Flag of height 100.

# Again, but a Flag of height 10,000

# Write a function with an input Flag height and a big jump height.
# Calculate the total number of jumps (small and big combined) 
# needed to reach the flag. A small jump is equal to 1 unit
